# Portfolio website.
My personal portfolio website. Open-sourced. Hosted at https://alliks.xyz

## Made as a project for a university course. Will be upgraded and worked towards afterwards aswell. 

Currently planned platforms and frameworks to be used :
  1) Basic website, aka, HTML, CSS and JS. 
  2) Upgraded to a React and TypeScript combination.
  3) Made publicly available APIs and Postgre database. 

# My playground basically.
