HTML code - 15% of the final grade
• The page has to be developed according to HTML 5 or XHTML1.0
• Strict standard. DOCTYPE has to be declared and the document must conform to it.
• The document must validate using the W3C validator (http://validator.w3.org).
• ID and class attributes must be used appropriately throughout the document.
• HTML elements must be used according to theirsemantics.
• HTML document must contain all of these element types:
– headings (different levels)
– lists (ordered and unordered)
– basic text formatting (paragraphs, line breaks, bold, italics)
– images
– data input form elements (later accessed from JavaScript code)
• UTF-8 encoding is used.
CSS code – 15% of the final grade
• The CSS code must be developed according to CSS 2.1 specification and must validate using
the CSS validator (http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator). Stable CSS3 properties may be used
as well, but vendor specific markup should not be used.
• Style information must be stored in a .CSS file linked to the HTMLdocument.
• Media queries must be included in CSS code. For example, a print version can be developed
where some parts (for instance, navigation) of the document are hidden. “Print preview”
function can be used for testing.
• At least 10 selectors have to be used in CSS document. All types of basic selectors have to be
used (element, class, identifier).
• Some part of the document must demonstrate how two or more classes can be formatted
using CSS.
Data input form and data validation using JavaScript – 10% of the final grade
• Validation of mandatory fields – a warning should be shown if some of the fields are not
filled.
• Data type validation (for instance, if the value entered in date field is actually a date; or if a
numeric field contains a number).
• Data range validation (for instance, if the number entered in ”month” field is between 1 and
12; or if the value in the salary field is positive).
• In case of validation errors, a message explaining the problem and naming the field/fields
with incorrect values has to be presented to the user. The form must not be submitted in this
case. If the form is filled correctly, it should be submitted to
https://www.w3schools.com/action_page.php .
Use of JavaScript for DOM manipulations – 10% of the final grade
• Changing visibility of some part of the document as a response to user interaction with some
part of the document (for instance, user clicks a button “more information” and an explanation
block is shown).
• Creation of new DOM elements from code (using DOM methods rather than assigning a
string containing HTML code to innerHTML).
• Some DOM manipulations have to be demonstrated without using any external libraries,
only by using plain document object model.
• Some other manipulations have to be implemented using a helper library (such as jQuery,
Prototype, MooTools, ExtJS).
